      How to Use Slack
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-copy-line-height nested-links nested-img mid-gray measure-wide-l">
        

<p>Our Slack network is an excellent platform to communicate and stay in touch with all of your fellow Civic Hall Members. There’s a channel relevant to almost any interest, but not all of them have daily activity or conversation. Therefore, the community team here at Civic Hall thought it’d be convenient to analyze which Slack channels typically have the most activity. </p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t see a channel that fits the topic of discussion you&rsquo;d like to participate in, you can always create a new channel or, try to spark conversation in less active channels too! </p>

<p>For more information, check the Slack Help website here: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fslack.zendesk.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNElgbiJI_aADmkxkeAFiJRXVwxrNQ">https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us</a></p>

<h3 id="slack-best-practices">Slack Best Practices</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do</strong> start channels for new interests groups.</li>
<li><strong><u>Do not use @everyone</u>.</strong> It will ping every user who is and isn&rsquo;t on Slack at the time. The community team would like to reserve this tag <strong>for emergencies or important announcements.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> use @here to grab the attention of members in the space or members of your channel. </li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> use Slack to find people&rsquo;s emails and add them to your newsletters without the members&rsquo; consent.</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> use Slack to reach out to fellow members you want to meet and collaborate with, especially if you forgot to exchange emails over coffee.</li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> use @channel in the #general channel. According to member feedback, this tends to be an unpopular action. </li>
<li><strong>Do</strong> use @channel in special interest group channels if there is relative and important information you want to share with everyone in that channel.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Here are some of our most popular Slack channels, as well as an idea of what type of conversation takes place in each of them:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/general/">#general</a></strong> Conversation and shared articles covering a wide range of topics(mostly on what’s happening in civic tech) take place here. Daily reminders of upcoming events are provided here as well. Aside from the civic tech world, there have been discussions on politics and just technology in general.For example, the recent announcement of the Iphone 7, a post on September 13th being a Primary day for Democrat voters, and letters to congress. This is probably the most popular Slack channel, and definitely a great place to be able to get a discussion going!</p>

<p><a href="https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/bookrecs/"><strong>#bookrecs</strong></a> Lots of interesting book suggestions and recommendations from members in this channel.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/code/">#code</a></strong>  Discussion includes a few web links to articles revolving around issues that impact the coding world, as well as members seeking out partners/fellow coders to assist them with different projects.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/freefood/">#freefood</a></strong>  People notify other members of opportunities for free food that pop up, whether it’s in the cafe, or outside.

<p><strong><a href="https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/lookingfor/">#lookingfor</a>  </strong>Mostly members seeking out others for help in various areas, whether it be data experts, people to help with campaigns, etc. It can also be similar to the Jobs channel, in the sense that people also post here in search of new employees as well.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/lostandfound/">#lostandfound</a>  </strong>If we find something in the space that a member left behind, we post it on this channel. So make sure to check it out if you ever lose something at Civic Hall!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Civic Hall Ambassador is &lt;strong&gt;your link between the business of Civic Hall and the community of Civic Hall&lt;/strong&gt;. Every member of Civic Hall is assigned an Ambassador during their first week of membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambassadors use their own experiences to provide you with an idea of what it is like to be an active and engaged member of the community. They will be initiating introductions, sharing information, and elevating ideas for events, programs &amp;amp; activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure of who your Ambassador is, please email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:community@civichall.org&#34;&gt;community@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

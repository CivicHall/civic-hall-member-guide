      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use the wonderful assortment of mugs and glasses in our kitchen for coffee, tea, and water. Please return them to the dishwasher when you are done with them and do not leave anything in the sink. If the dishwasher is full, please wash your own dishes by hand and place them on the drying rack/mat. The refrigerator will be cleaned out every evening at 7pm. All items left after 7pm will be discarded. Due to limited space, there are no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please be mindful of the cleanliness of your workspace, and clean up after yourself and your guests. Food trash should be disposed of immediately in one of the many trash and recycling containers distributed throughout the space. Pitching in is part of the culture here at Civic Hall and we encourage everyone to do their part in maintaining a great home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Children Policy</title>
      <link>https://membership-guide.civichall.org/guidelines/children-policy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 14:37:34 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://membership-guide.civichall.org/guidelines/children-policy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your children are welcome at Civic Hall for the occasional need. Please be mindful that Civic Hall is designed as a work environment. When you have children here, as with all guests, please be aware of noise levels, food, use of space, and general behavior so to be considerate of the other members of our community. Our Community Space was not designed for children to be present other than for specific events to which they are invited, or for the occasional urgent childcare need. In either event, you are responsible for your child&amp;rsquo;s behavior while here and should make sure they act in a way that does not affect the professional use of the space by other members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please notify us in advance when you require to have your child (anyone under 16 years of age) here by contacting our Community Team at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:community@civichall.org&#34;&gt;community@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Members can have a guest in the space for up to 3 hours at no charge. If you need your guest to stay past 3 hours, you will be charged a $35 day pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All guests must sign in when they arrive, and sign out when they leave. If your guest leaves and does not sign out, we will assume they stayed past the 3 hour limit and your account will be charged $35 for a day pass.&lt;/p&gt;

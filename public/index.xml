      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Civic Hall Ambassador is &lt;strong&gt;your link between the business of Civic Hall and the community of Civic Hall&lt;/strong&gt;. Every member of Civic Hall is assigned an Ambassador during their first week of membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambassadors use their own experiences to provide you with an idea of what it is like to be an active and engaged member of the community. They will be initiating introductions, sharing information, and elevating ideas for events, programs &amp;amp; activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure of who your Ambassador is, please email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:community@civichall.org&#34;&gt;community@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use the wonderful assortment of mugs and glasses in our kitchen for coffee, tea, and water.

If the dishwasher is full, please wash your own dishes by hand and place them on the drying rack/mat. The refrigerator will be cleaned out every evening at 7pm. All items left after 7pm will be discarded. Due to limited space, there are no exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://membership-guide.civichall.org/guidelines/children-policy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your children are welcome at Civic Hall for the occasional need. Please be mindful that Civic Hall is designed as a work environment. When you have children here, as with all guests, please be aware of noise levels, food, use of space, and general behavior so to be considerate of the other members of our community. Our Community Space was not designed for children to be present other than for specific events to which they are invited, or for the occasional urgent childcare need. In either event, you are responsible for your child&amp;rsquo;s behavior while here and should make sure they act in a way that does not affect the professional use of the space by other members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please notify us in advance when you require to have your child (anyone under 16 years of age) here by contacting our Community Team at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:community@civichall.org&#34;&gt;community@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All guests must sign in when they arrive, and sign out when they leave. If your guest leaves and does not sign out, we will assume they stayed past the 3 hour limit and your account will be charged $35 for a day pass.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We recognize that New York City Public Schools are closed for mid-winter recess and want to remind our members that your children are welcome at Civic Hall for the occasional need. Please be mindful that Civic Hall is designed as a work environment. When you have children here, as with all guests, please be aware of noise levels, food, use of space, and general behavior so to be considerate of the other members of our community. If you have questions about our &amp;ldquo;Children at Civic Hall Policy&amp;rdquo;or would like to request a special accommodation, please contact our Community team: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:community@civichall.org&#34;&gt;community@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

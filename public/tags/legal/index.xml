&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE OF COOKIES&lt;/strong&gt;
We use cookies on the Civic Hall Sites. By using the Civic Hall Sites, you accept the use of cookies in accordance with this Privacy &amp;amp; Data Usage Policy. If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them following the instructions in this Privacy &amp;amp; Data Usage Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IS A COOKIE?&lt;/strong&gt;
Cookies are small text files that websites place in your browser when you visit them. When you return to the site, the site can access its previously placed cookie to uniquely identify your browser. Cookies accomplish several different things. They recall your preferences at a website, help content render more efficiently, and improve the overall user experience on a website. They can also help advertisers see what interests you and what advertising may be relevant to you. For further information on cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allaboutcookies.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.allaboutcookies.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE ON THE CIVIC HALL SITES?&lt;/strong&gt;
We primarily use two different types of cookies on this website: (1) Strictly Necessary Cookies and (2) Analytics Cookies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features and services, such as accessing secure areas of the website. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytics Cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies do not collect information that identifies you. All the information that these cookies collect is anonymous and is used only to improve a website’s services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the Civic Hall Sites use Google Analytics Cookies. Information collected by the Google Analytics cookies will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States of America in accordance with its privacy practices. To see an overview of privacy at Google and how this applies to Google Analytics, visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-analytics&#34;&gt;http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-analytics&lt;/a&gt;. You may opt out of tracking by Google Analytics by visiting &lt;a href=&#34;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB&#34;&gt;https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MANAGING COOKIES&lt;/strong&gt;
You can enable, disable or delete cookies within your browser. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” menu). Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser; you will need to do this yourself from within your browser by choosing the option to delete cookies. If you have disabled one or more analytics cookies, we may still use information collected from cookies prior to your disabled preference being set, however, we will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not knowingly obtain or store any Social Security Numbers or other government Issued identifiers; insurance plan numbers; financial account numbers; information that describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual; or precise information related to health or medical conditions (collectively “Sensitive Consumer Information”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are made aware that we have received information from anyone under the age of 13 or Sensitive Consumer Information in violation of this Privacy &amp;amp; Data Usage Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate and remove that information from our records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Renewal, Invoicing and Additional Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Membership is automatically renewed at the end of each month (or year if you purchased an annual membership) unless cancelled in accordance with Section 5 below. Should you choose to pay on a monthly basis, you will be automatically invoiced monthly, in advance, based on your membership subscription. Should you choose to pay for your membership annually, you will be automatically involved annually, in advance, based on your subscription. Depending on additional services used, your invoice will include any adjustable charges, such as overage fees for additional conference room usage that may have been incurred during the previous payment period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fees, including any overage fees, shall be charged on the first of every month. Should you choose to begin your membership in the middle of the month, you will be charged prorated Fees for your first month, and then charged in full the first of the following month. The Fees applicable to your account may be subject to modification from time to time pursuant to notice provided by us at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date on which your membership renews (“Renewal Date”). Your continued use of the services following such notice and through the Renewal Date constitutes your agreement to such modified fees. You may at any time cancel your account as set forth in Section 5 if you do not agree to any modified fees. All fees must be paid in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable, except for those prepaid fees that shall be refunded on a prorated basis in accordance with Section 5 below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrades, Cancellation and Deferral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may upgrade your current membership at any time. You will be charged the pro-rated difference between your current plan and the upgraded plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may cancel your current membership plan upon 30 days’ notice to Civic Hall by e-mailing us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:community@civichall.org&#34;&gt;info@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;. Please include “Cancellation” in the subject line and provide your name and membership number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members who have pre-paid for the year will receive a pro-rated refund of their Fees minus a $500.00 termination fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members may change their membership plan upon 30 days’ notice to Civic Hall at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:info@civichall.org&#34;&gt;info@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Tenancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your payment of Fees is solely in exchange for a pre-paid usage license for the Services consistent with these Terms and in no respect creates a tenancy between you and Civic Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure of Your Personal Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic Hall reserves the right to disclose your personal information, without prior notice to you, as required by law or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or any legal request (e.g. court order or subpoena) served on Civic Hall. Furthermore, we may share your personal information when we believe it is necessary to address fraud or other illegal or activity prohibited under these Terms perpetrated through the Services, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. However, nothing in these Terms are intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic Hall uses your personal information primarily for processing your membership application, providing you the services you request, and processing your payments. For more information on how Civic Hall uses your information please refer to the Civic Hall Privacy Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer of Warranties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Civic Hall provides the Services “as is” and with all faults, and hereby disclaim with respect to the services all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, any (if any) warranties, duties or conditions of or related to: merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, lack of viruses, accuracy or completeness of responses, results, workmanlike effort and lack of negligence. Also, there is no warranty, duty or condition of title, quiet enjoyment, quiet possession, correspondence to description or non-infringement. The entire risk as to the quality, or arising out of participation in or the use of the services, remains with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusion of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Civic Hall or its subsidiaries (whether or not wholly-owned), affiliates, divisions, and their past, present and future officers, agents, shareholders, members, representatives, employees, successors and assigns, jointly or individually be liable for any direct, special, incidental, indirect, punitive, consequential or other damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for: loss of profits, loss of confidential or other information, business interruption, personal injury, loss of privacy, failure to meet any duty (including of good faith or of reasonable care), negligence, and any other pecuniary or other loss whatsoever) arising out of or in any way related to the participation in or inability to participate in or use of the services, the provision of or failure to provide services, or otherwise under or in connection with any provision of this agreement, even in the event of the fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, breach of contract or breach of warranty of Civic Hall, and even if Civic Hall has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitation of Liability and Remedies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, all damages referenced above and all direct or general damages), the entire liability of Civic Hall or its subsidiaries (whether or not wholly-owned), affiliates, divisions, and their past, present and future officers, agents, shareholders, members, representatives, employees, successors and assigns under any provision of these Terms and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to actual damages incurred by you based on reasonable reliance up to the amounts paid by you in Fees in the previous calendar year. The foregoing limitations, exclusions and disclaimers (including sections 11 and 12 above) shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails its essential purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic Hall reserves the right to terminate any Service at any time. Civic Hall further reserves the right to terminate your participation in and use of any Services, immediately and without notice, if you fail to comply with the Terms. In the event Civic Hall terminates your membership, and you have purchased a pre-paid annual membership, we will refund to you the remaining pro-rated portion of your pre-paid membership fee minus a $500.00 termination fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indemnification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You release, and hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Civic Hall and Civic Hall’s subsidiaries (whether or not wholly-owned), affiliates, divisions, and their past, present and future officers, agents, shareholders, members, representatives, employees, successors and assigns, jointly and individually, from and against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, expenses, judgments, fines and penalties based upon or arising out of your negligent actions, errors and omissions, willful misconduct and fraud in connection with the participation in or use of the Services. You further agree in the event that you bring a claim or lawsuit in violation of this agreement, you shall be liable for any attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Civic Hall or its respective officers and agents in connection with the defense of such claim or lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event that any provision or portion of these Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of these Terms shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choice of Law and Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Terms will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws. Any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought by either party is less than $10,000 shall be resolved via binding non-appearance-based arbitration initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. In any such arbitration, the parties and AAA must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, where the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; &amp;copy; the arbitrator may award injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim; and (d) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any claim which is not subject to arbitration pursuant to the foregoing paragraph shall be adjudicated exclusively in the courts located in the County of New York and in the federal courts in the Southern District of New York.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute subject to arbitration under the preceding section will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any such dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insurance, Your Personal Property and Use of Our Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic Hall will carry Liability and Business Personal Property insurance. As a member, it is strongly suggested that you carry your own personal insurance policy to cover your own equipment while using our space. That policy may cover your current residence/office, as well as the premises of Civic Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You acknowledge that you are participating in and/or using the Civic Hall services at your own free will and decision. You acknowledge that Civic Hall does not have any liability with respect to your access, participation in, use of the services, or any loss of information resulting from such participation or use, and carries no responsibility any property you may leave at Civic Hall or in one of Civic Hall’s lockers overnight. Civic Hall does not have liability for the actions of our members. We do not endorse, support or verify the facts, opinions or recommendations of our members. We assume no responsibility for any personal property left at the Civic Hall premise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Code of Conduct</title>
      <link>https://membership-guide.civichall.org/guidelines/code-of-conduct/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2017 23:52:17 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://membership-guide.civichall.org/guidelines/code-of-conduct/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Membership at Civic Hall means that the collaboration center, workspace, activities, events, and digital forums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;background-color:transparent&#34;&gt;Civic Hall reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Civic Hall membership, network activities, events, and digital forums.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civic Hall&amp;rsquo;s Anti-Harassment Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Civic Hall members, network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.&lt;br /&gt;
Civic Hall is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of members, staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Civic Hall event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may expelled from Civic Hall membership, network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the Executive Staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Civic Hall membership, network activities, events, and digital forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Executive Staff immediately. You can contact them at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:leadership@civichall.org&#34;&gt;leadership@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt;. The Civic Hall Executive Staff will be happy to help members and/or participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot reach an Executive Staff member and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also contact Civic Hall about harassment at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:community@civichall.org&#34;&gt;community@civichall.org&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to use the email template below. Civic Hall staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact that our team is not always present. However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Template for Anti-Harassment Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

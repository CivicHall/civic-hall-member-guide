<p><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong>
We use cookies on the Civic Hall Sites. By using the Civic Hall Sites, you accept the use of cookies in accordance with this Privacy &amp; Data Usage Policy. If you do not accept the use of these cookies, please disable them following the instructions in this Privacy &amp; Data Usage Policy.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS A COOKIE?</strong>
Cookies are small text files that websites place in your browser when you visit them. When you return to the site, the site can access its previously placed cookie to uniquely identify your browser. Cookies accomplish several different things. They recall your preferences at a website, help content render more efficiently, and improve the overall user experience on a website. They can also help advertisers see what interests you and what advertising may be relevant to you. For further information on cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE ON THE CIVIC HALL SITES?</strong>
We primarily use two different types of cookies on this website: (1) Strictly Necessary Cookies and (2) Analytics Cookies:</p>

<p>Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features and services, such as accessing secure areas of the website. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.</p>

<p>Analytics Cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies do not collect information that identifies you. All the information that these cookies collect is anonymous and is used only to improve a website’s services.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Civic Hall Sites use Google Analytics Cookies. Information collected by the Google Analytics cookies will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States of America in accordance with its privacy practices. To see an overview of privacy at Google and how this applies to Google Analytics, visit <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-analytics">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-analytics</a>. You may opt out of tracking by Google Analytics by visiting <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MANAGING COOKIES</strong>
You can enable, disable or delete cookies within your browser. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” menu). Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser; you will need to do this yourself from within your browser by choosing the option to delete cookies. If you have disabled one or more analytics cookies, we may still use information collected from cookies prior to your disabled preference being set, however, we will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information.</p>

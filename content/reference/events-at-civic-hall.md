title: Can I Still Host Events At Civic Hall?
---
**Yes!** All events that happen at Civic Hall, including community events, are managed through our Events Team. If you would like to host an event, please use [**this form**](http://www.civichallevents.org/request-a-date/) to submit a request to them.

Some events will require the community workspace to be cleared by 5:30pm. Keep your eyes open for signage!

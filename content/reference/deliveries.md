**Civic Hall does <u>not</u> accept mail or package deliveries.** All packages will be returned to sender. If you need special accommodations, due to an event or other special circumstance, please email community@civichall.org with your request.

**Food Deliveries:** Civic Hall will accept pre-paid, pre-tipped food deliveries only. If you have a food delivery on the way, please let the Welcome Desk know so that they know who to give the delivery to. When your food arrives we will send you a text message (if your mobile number is listed in your [member profile](https://civichall.spaces.nexudus.com/en/profile)) and/or send you a message through [Slack]({{< ref "reference/how-to-use-slack.md" >}} ).Â

The community space was designed to promote collaboration and connection. This is a place where **interaction and conversations are encouraged**.

Please be **mindful and respectful** with voice projection levels. Phone calls and video calls can be conducted in one of the six multi-colored **phone booths**, or you can **reserve a phone room** in the [booking calendar](https://civichall.spaces.nexudus.com/en/bookings/calendar).Â

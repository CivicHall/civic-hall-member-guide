**Domestic pets that are not licensed service animals are not permitted at Civic Hall.**

An employee, or a member, who requires the help of a service animal (defined by [28 CFR 36.104](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/36.104) as **"any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability"**) will be permitted to bring a service animal to the workspace, provided that the animalâ€™s presence does not create a danger to others and does not impose an undue hardship upon the company.

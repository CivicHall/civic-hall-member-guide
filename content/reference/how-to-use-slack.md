title: How to Use Slack
---

Our Slack network is an excellent platform to communicate and stay in touch with all of your fellow Civic Hall Members. There’s a channel relevant to almost any interest, but not all of them have daily activity or conversation. Therefore, the community team here at Civic Hall thought it’d be convenient to analyze which Slack channels typically have the most activity. 

If you don't see a channel that fits the topic of discussion you'd like to participate in, you can always create a new channel or, try to spark conversation in less active channels too! 



* * *



Here are some of our most popular Slack channels, as well as an idea of what type of conversation takes place in each of them:

**[#general](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/general/)** Conversation and shared articles covering a wide range of topics(mostly on what’s happening in civic tech) take place here. Daily reminders of upcoming events are provided here as well. Aside from the civic tech world, there have been discussions on politics and just technology in general.For example, the recent announcement of the Iphone 7, a post on September 13th being a Primary day for Democrat voters, and letters to congress. This is probably the most popular Slack channel, and definitely a great place to be able to get a discussion going!

[**#bookrecs**](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/bookrecs/) Lots of interesting book suggestions and recommendations from members in this channel.

**[#calltoaction](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/calltoaction/)**

**[#civicwomen](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/civicwomen/details/)**


**[#code](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/code/)**  Discussion includes a few web links to articles revolving around issues that impact the coding world, as well as members seeking out partners/fellow coders to assist them with different projects.

**[#freefood](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/freefood/)**  People notify other members of opportunities for free food that pop up, whether it’s in the cafe, or outside. (Definitely a channel to keep an eye on!) There tends to be opportunities for free bites to eat pretty often.

**[#random](https://civichallmembers.slack.com/messages/random/)**  One can find a member searching for help with a name for his cat, links to articles about the economy, art, and practically anything and everything (hence the title.)

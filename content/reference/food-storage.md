title: Where Can I Keep My Food?

There is a refrigerator in the kitchen. Label your food and leave it there during the day, but **do not leave it overnight**. 

The refrigerator gets cleaned out by Civic Hall's Community Caretaker staff at 7:00pm every day. All **items left after 7pm will be discarded**. Due to limited space, there are no exceptions.


Civic Hall is not responsible for lost or stolen items.

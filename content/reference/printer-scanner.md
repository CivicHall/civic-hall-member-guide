tags: ['Technology']

Please use the printer for **SMALL PRINT JOBS** only (less than 20 pages). 


**Connect To The Printer:**

via bonjour for HP OfficeJet Color FlowMFP X585, or 

via IP: 192.168.118.10

If you have trouble connecting to the printers or if a printer is out of ink or paper, please come see the Welcome Desk.

**Need to scan something?**
We have a USB thumb drive at the front desk for members to borrow. Please return it to the Welcome Desk when you are done.

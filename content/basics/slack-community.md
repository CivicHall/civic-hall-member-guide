Our Slack network is an excellent platform to communicate and stay in touch with all of your fellow Civic Hall Members. There’s a channel relevant to almost any interest, but not all of them have daily activity or conversation. Therefore, the community team here at Civic Hall thought it’d be convenient to analyze which Slack channels typically have the most activity.

Here are some of our most popular Slack channels, as well as an idea of what type of conversation takes place in each of them:

**#calltoaction** Join the resistance.

**#civicwome**n Celebrate and support your fellow Civic Women!

<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><b>#freefood</b> People notify other members of opportunities for free food that pop up, whether it’s in the cafe, or outside. (</span>Definitely<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> a channel to keep an eye on!) There </span>tend<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;to be opportunities for free bites to eat pretty often.</span>

**#funding-_-opps** Funding and Opportunities: Competitions, Grants, Accelerators, Incubators, non-profit, grant writing tips, speaking/expert panel opps, funding panel opps., etc.

**#jobs** Links to various job opportunities in civic tech are shared here. A good place to post if you’re looking for an opportunity or looking prospective employees.

**#lookingfor** Mostly members seeking out others for help in various areas, whether it be data experts, people to help with campaigns, etc. It can also be similar to the Jobs channel, in the sense that people also post here in search of new employees as well.

**#lostandfound** If we find something in the space that a member left behind, we post it on this channel. So make sure to check it out if you ever lose something at Civic Hall!

<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><b>#random</b> One can find a member searching for help with a name for his </span>cat,<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> links to articles about the economy, art, and practically anything and everything (hence the title.) A good channel to use if you’d like to discuss a wide range of topics.</span>

**#the-suggestion-box** A place to throw out your crazy and most awesome ideas for making Civic Hall the coolest place on the planet.

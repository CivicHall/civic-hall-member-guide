There is a refrigerator in the kitchen. Label your food and leave it there during the day, but **do not leave it overnight**.

The refrigerator gets cleaned out by Civic Hall's Community Caretaker staff at 7:00pm every day. AllÂ **items left after 7pm will be discarded**. Due to limited space, there are no exceptions.

Civic Hall is not responsible for lost or stolen items.

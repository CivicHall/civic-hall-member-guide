Please use the printer for **SMALL PRINT JOBS** only (less than **20** pages).

**Connect To The Printer:**

via bonjour for HP OfficeJet Color FlowMFP X585, or

via IP: 192.168.118.10

If you have trouble connecting to the printers or if a printer is out of ink or paper, please come see the Welcome Desk.

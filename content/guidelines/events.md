As a collaboration center, we will often have activities and events happening in the space.

You can find a calendar of upcoming events here: [civichall.org/events](https://civichall.org/eventscal/)

Some events will require the community workspace to be cleared starting at 5:00pm. Please refer to this calendar and signage in the space for information on when and where these events will be happening.

Civic Hall can also be reserved for private meetings and events. If you'd like to book space for an event, you can submit your request via: [https://civichall.org/host-an-event/](https://civichall.org/host-an-event/ "https://civichall.org/host-an-event/")

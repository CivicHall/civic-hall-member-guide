**Yes!** All events that happen at Civic Hall, including community events, are managed through our Events Team. If you would like to host an event, please use [**this form**](https://civichall.org/host-an-event/) to submit a request to them.

Some events will require the community workspace to be cleared by a specific time. Keep your eyes open for signage!

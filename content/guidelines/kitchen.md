Feel free to use the wonderful assortment of mugs and glasses in our kitchen for coffee, tea, and water. Please return them to the dishwasher when you are done with them and do not leave anything in the sink. If the dishwasher is full, please wash your own dishes by hand and place them on the drying rack/mat. The refrigerator will be cleaned out every Friday.

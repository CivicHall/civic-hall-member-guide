Members are welcome to have guests in the space for meetings, visits, and work sessions. We ask that your guests respect our community guidelines and sign in when they arrive. Guests can stay up to 3 hours free of charge. If guests would like to stay longer, you must purchase $20 day pass for them. Guest passes can be purchased online in the member portal.

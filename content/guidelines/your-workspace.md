title: Your Workspace
---
Please be mindful of the cleanliness of your workspace, and clean up after yourself and your guests. Food trash should be disposed of immediately in one of the many trash and recycling containers distributed throughout the space. Pitching in is part of the culture here at Civic Hall and we encourage everyone to do their part in maintaining a great home.

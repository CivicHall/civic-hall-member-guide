Amazon Web Services provides infrastructure that allows startups to grow and thrive, and AWS Activate is a program that allows you to access those resources quickly. From Technical and Business Essentials Online Trainings to Promotional Credits that can be used on a variety of AWS products, this offer provides an unparalleled opportunity for folks who are getting started and looking to scale up. Interested? Applying is easy for members of the Civic Hall community!  
  
First, visit the AWS Activate webpage [https://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-signup](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-signup "https://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-signup") to apply.

1. Use this Organization ID (case-sensitive): **0eqef**
2. Provide your **AWS Account ID** on the application. Promotional Credits will be added directly to this account, so please double check it - we cannot transfer credits in the future.
3. Please provide your **company domain email address** regardless of the email associated with your AWS Account ID. Personal email addresses are likely to be unrecognized and rejected, complicating application processing and billing inquiries.

We'll kick off with dedicated Civic Hall office hours mid-March at the AWS Loft. Any questions? Email [community@civichall.org](mailto:community@civichall.org)![Inline image 1](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/784ac4a90c07e1e7ebbf294d4/_compresseds/68b346f6-1aca-4eed-a11a-fdabc4e742e5.jpg =600x300)

In light of our country’s divided history and the momentous events of the past year, it’s more important than ever to build with, not for. Inspired by these events we have created an event series titled “Part of the Conversation.”  
  
Our mission is to change the dynamics of the conversations regarding people of color and marginalized populations. We strive to cultivate an environment where these members of society are invited to actively participate in the conversation, rather than simply being the topic of discussion.  
  
Please stay tuned to our website, social media and newsletters for updates on **POTC**'s inaugural Black History Month programming!  
  
**SPRING ENTREPRENEURS-IN-RESIDENCE COHORT**  
Our Spring 2018 cohort of Entrepreneurs in Residence are a diverse bunch—you can find all awarded organizations and individuals on the [Entrepreneurs in Residence site](https://www.civiceir.org/).  
  
**CIVIC HALL IS IN SEARCH OF RELIABLE & DETAIL-ORIENTED HOUSE MANAGERS**  
A House Manager is someone who will be fully responsible for the smooth running of each event. They will oversee final event space and AV set-up, run AV during the event, maintain accurate records of Event Attendees, respond to all escalated guest issues and determine appropriate actions to resolve problems and/or issues in a timely, positive, and friendly  
manner, and oversee breakdowns and load-out at the conclusion of any event.  
  
We are looking for individuals with strong time management skills. This is a great for individuals and/or organizations wishing to host after-hour events at Civic Hall and need to save a few dollars on staffing fees. Those not hosting events will be compensated for their time.  
  
Please contact [events@civichall.org](mailto:events@civichall.org) if you are interested.

**GETTING TO 80% - BUILDING TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE NATIONAL VOTER TURNOUT & PARTICIPATION ACROSS AMERICA**  
**Tuesday, February 13. 6.00pm – 8.00pm ET**  
AppNexus, [28 West 23rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY, 10010](https://maps.google.com/?q=28+West+23rd+Street,+4th+Floor,+New+York,+NY,+10010&entry=gmail&source=g)  
   
On February 13, AppNexus are hosting a tech talk with [Democracy Works](https://democracy.works/) - a NYC-based team of software developers, public policy wonks, and civic organizers building the tools needed to upgrade the infrastructure of our democracy and improve the voting experience for voters and election officials alike. Their vision is straightforward: make voting a simple, seamless experience for all Americans so that no one misses an election.  
   
To this end, Democracy Works developed TurboVote, a web application built on a microservices architecture that helps you register to vote, request an absentee ballot, and receive election reminders; they work with local election offices throughout the US to collect, clean, and standardize a national polling place dataset (among other things); and they provide an API in front of a detailed calendar of upcoming state, special, and local elections. Recently, TurboVote integrated with AppNexus’ FIA alert hub to serve real-time, geo-targeted election reminders nationally.   
   
This talk will explore Democracy Work’s products and strategic approach, and showcase opportunities to get involved.

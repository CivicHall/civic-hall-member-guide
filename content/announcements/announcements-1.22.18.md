**PART OF THE CONVERSATION SERIES**

In light of our country’s divided history and the momentous events of the past year, it’s more important than ever to build with, not for. Inspired by these events we have created an event series titled “Part of the Conversation.”  
  
Our mission is to change the dynamics of the conversations regarding people of color and marginalized populations. We strive to cultivate an environment where these members of society are invited to actively participate in the conversation, rather than simply being the topic of discussion.  
  
Please stay tuned to our website, social media and newsletters for updates on **POTC**'s inaugural Black History Month programming!  
  
**CIVIC HALL IS IN SEARCH OF RELIABLE & DETAIL-ORIENTED HOUSE MANAGERS**  
A House Manager is someone who will be fully responsible for the smooth running of each event. They will oversee final event space and AV set-up, run AV during the event, maintain accurate records of Event Attendees, respond to all escalated guest issues and determine appropriate actions to resolve problems and/or issues in a timely, positive, and friendly  
manner, and oversee breakdowns and load-out at the conclusion of any event.  
  
We are looking for individuals with strong time management skills. This is a great for individuals and/or organizations wishing to host after-hour events at Civic Hall and need to save a few dollars on staffing fees. Those not hosting events will be compensated for their time.  
  
Please contact [events@civichall.org](mailto:events@civichall.org) if you are interested.  
  
**LAST DAYS TO APPLY: CIVIC HALL ORGANIZERS-IN-RESIDENCE SPRING CYCLE APPLICATIONS OPEN**  
All the time in American public life, millions of people are in motion, seeking to engage elected officials and shift public opinion, forming and joining thousands of national and local groups. At the center of all of this activity are **organizers**, often working in isolation from home or in challenging settings like crowded coffee shops or impersonal co-working spaces, where they miss out on many forms of mutual support, including skill-sharing, connections and problem-solving.  
  
Civic Hall, through the support of the [**Craig Newmark Foundation**](http://craignewmarkphilanthropies.org/), wants to change that dynamic by offering individuals and small teams involved in organizing to defend democracy and civil rights free memberships in our collaborative community center, along with mentoring and support amplifying their messages across our platform.   
  
The application deadline is **January 24th  –**  [**APPLY HERE**](https://civichall.org/programs/organizers-in-residence-program/)  
  
**COMING SOON: SPRING ENTREPRENEURS-IN-RESIDENCE COHORT ANNOUNCEMENT**  
Stay tuned for our Spring 2018 cohort of Entrepreneurs in Residence—we'll be announcing it later this week on the [Entrepreneurs in Residence site](https://www.civiceir.org/).

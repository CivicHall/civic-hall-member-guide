**CIVIC HALL @ UNION SQUARE UPDATE AND REQUEST**  
As you may already know, as part of the public review process, at the end of February Community Board 3 voted unanimously, 36 to 0, to support the Civic Hall @ Union Square project.    
  
The next stage of this process involves a review by and public hearing with Borough President Gale Brewer. She has not only been a huge supporter of this project since the beginning, but also been an active partner with Civic Hall. If you would like to express your support for the project and thanks to Gale, please take a few minutes to email the Borough President at: [info@manhattanbp.nyc.gov](mailto:info@manhattanbp.nyc.gov).  
  
On behalf of everyone at Civic Hall, we want to express our thanks to all the Civic Hall members, partners and friends who have come out during this early part of the process. Your voices and stories have made a tremendous impact.  
  
While the public process will still take several months to get to completion, we are well on our away to building a future expanded home for Civic Hall and the city's first collaborative digital skills training center. We are looking forward to moving forward together!

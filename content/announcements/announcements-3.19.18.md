**CIVIC HALL TEAM UPDATES**  
As we work through the merger of Civic Hall and Civic Hall Labs and focus our efforts on the development of Civic Hall @ Union Square, and on the ramping up of a new digital learning center that will be central to that facility, some of the staff roles at Civic Hall are going through substantial changes. Unfortunately, sometimes those decisions mean saying goodbye to people who we love and respect.  
  
We want to take a moment to recognize the contributions of Olivia Snarski, Membership Engagement director, Tamika Taylor, Interim Events Director, and Nick Masercola, Communications Associate, all of whom transitioned out of Civic Hall a week ago. Though we are sorry to see them go, we hope and expect that they will continue to participate in the Civic Hall community as members.

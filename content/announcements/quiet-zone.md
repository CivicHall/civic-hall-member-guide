The area to the right of the printer (and to the left of Civic Hall Labs' office) will now be a QUIET ZONE. Please do not take phone calls or have conversations in this area.

While we know it is impossible to have a completely quiet area, we would like to offer a focused work environment for those of you that have requested it.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to let us know. We will do our best to accommodate you.

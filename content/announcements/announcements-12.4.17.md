**NYC OPEN DATA WEEK 2018 SUBMISSIONS**  
[NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) is a platform run by the City of New York containing nearly 2,000 data assets published by City Agencies - from street tree data, to 311 service requests to traffic speeds - we’re putting information on how the City runs back in the hands of New Yorkers. To raise awareness about this free resource the NYC Open Data Team partnered with the civic technology community to produce [Open Data Week 2017](https://www.open-data.nyc/) which engaged over 900 New Yorkers! We’re now [asking for submissions of ideas for Open Data Week 2018](http://bit.ly/ODW18) and hope you’ll share an idea. The deadline for submissions is December 15th. Email: [aschmoeker@analytics.nyc.gov](mailto:aschmoeker@analytics.nyc.gov) with any questions, [you can also learn more via our coverage in StateScoop a few weeks ago](http://statescoop.com/as-outreach-efforts-mature-nyc-announces-open-data-week-2018)!  
 

**DOTEVERYONE TRUSTWORTHY TECH SLACK COMMUNITY & PARTNERS PROGRAM**  
[Doteveryone](http://doteveryone.org.uk/)'s Trustworthy Tech slack:  we hope this will become a valuable community of practice for people working on digital /internet technologies and seeking to do so responsibly. All welcome to join - sign up: [bit.ly/TTSlack](http://bit.ly/TTSlack)  
  
The Trustworthy Tech Partners program is an 8 week exploration of how ethical and responsible an organisation's business and technology practices are, and whether it's possible to demonstrate these. Any organisation working on a digital/internet product/service is welcome to take part, and the next program will start on November 20th, and we'd love to have some participants from the Civic Hall community. The program will take participants through exploring what they do today in terms of responsible practices, and what evidence can be provided to demonstrate trustworthiness to external folks (customers, investors, other stakeholders etc). It could take 2-4 hours a week over 8 weeks (depending on scale of organisation) and it's also totally fine to timebox to, say, an hour a week, or to save up tasks to do in a batch on one day. More info in the [program booklet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LKPJv1Enk5YSqqC57-s5H0aMTEXqg1nS/view?usp=sharing) (disregard the dates, these were for our UK program)  
  
Key benefits of participation:   
\* pioneer a better tech sector which is responsible and trustworthy  
\* a structure to help you evaluate your current performance and spot opportunities for improvement  
\* feedback and support from independent confidential external advisors (about the program and other issues around responsible tech development!)  
  
Sign up, or fix a time for a call to discuss further, by emailing [laura.james@doteveryone.org.uk](mailto:laura.james@doteveryone.org.uk)  
  
**HOLIDAY HOURS**   
Mark your calendar: Civic Hall will close at **5pm** on **Friday, 12/22**, and reopen as usual after New Year's Day on **Tuesday, 1/2/18**.

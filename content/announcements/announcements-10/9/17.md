**OUR FIRST WOMEN'S UNCONFERENCE**

Civic Hall is excited to present our first Women's Unconference, in partnership with LMHQ and Civic Women, on the evening of Thursday, November 30th. This event will emphasize the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants about innovations in women’s advocacy and female empowerment.

**OPEN DEBATE COALITION: SUBMIT & VOTE FOR QUESTIONS**

Over the next two weeks, New York City will hold debates for Mayor, Public Advocate, and Comptroller -- and we have a chance to influence what questions the moderators ask the candidates!

Civic Hall has been working with the good folks at the Open Debates Coalition, and as a sponsor of these debates, we are pleased to announce that for the first time ever, the public can submit and vote on questions online. The Top 40 questions with the most votes from New Yorkers are eligible to be chosen by the debate hosts -- and they've guaranteed that they’ll use 15 of them in the live debates!

There are tons of other great questions at [www.OpenDebateQuestions.com/?source=civichall](www.OpenDebateQuestions.com/?source=civichall). So cast some more votes on questions you care about, invite your friends to do the same, and then tune in to NY1 or [www.OpenDebateQuestions.com/?source=civichall](www.OpenDebateQuestions.com/?source=civichall) to watch the debates live and find out which questions get asked!

The Mayoral debate is on Tuesday, October 10 at 7pm. The Public Advocate debate is on Monday, October 16 at 7pm. And the Comptroller debate is on Tuesday, October 17 at 7pm.

Thanks for helping us get the word out, and good luck with your own questions!

The Open Debate Coalition is a nonpartisan coalition of progressives, conservatives, and tech leaders working to make political debates more representative of the will of regular voters and local groups. For more information and a list of the coalition members, visit [http://opendebatecoalition.com](http://opendebatecoalition.com).

**INAUGURAL EMERGE NEW YORK TRAINING**

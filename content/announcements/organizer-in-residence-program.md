**Are you an organizer? Are you working to defend democracy and civil rights? Do you need a home base? Are you looking to hone your skills?**

Civic Hall, through the support of the **Craig Newmark Foundation**, wants to offer individuals currently organizing to defend democracy and civil rights free memberships in our collaborative community center, along with mentoring and support amplifying their messages across our platform.

Each organizer in this program will receive a full-time 6-month community membership in Civic Hall with 5 hours free conference room time per month, one-on-one mentoring support from Civic Hallâ€™s co-founders **Micah Sifry** and **Andrew Rasiej**, and a biweekly master class led by **Seth Godin** in leadership development; strategy and tactics; storytelling, narrative and marketing.

**HOLIDAY HOURS**   
Civic Hall will be closed next **Monday, January 15**, in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 

**CIVIC HALL ORGANIZERS-IN-RESIDENCE SPRING CYCLE APPLICATIONS OPEN**  
All the time in American public life, millions of people are in motion, seeking to engage elected officials and shift public opinion, forming and joining thousands of national and local groups. At the center of all of this activity are **organizers**, often working in isolation from home or in challenging settings like crowded coffee shops or impersonal co-working spaces, where they miss out on many forms of mutual support, including skill-sharing, connections and problem-solving.  
  
Civic Hall, through the support of the [**Craig Newmark Foundation**](http://craignewmarkphilanthropies.org/), wants to change that dynamic by offering individuals and small teams involved in organizing to defend democracy and civil rights free memberships in our collaborative community center, along with mentoring and support amplifying their messages across our platform.   
  
The application deadline is **January 24th  –**  [**APPLY HERE**](https://civichall.org/programs/organizers-in-residence-program/)

[Civic Hall](https://civichall.org/) is launching the **Civic Hall Digital Learning Center (DLC)** to address the nonprofit digital leadership gap by providing professional development classes and workshops aimed specifically at building the digital, data and technology literacy of New York City nonprofit organizations and their leaders. Civic Hall will start the DLC programming off with a **year-long pilot**aimed at serving some 400 individuals from an estimated 100 organizations across the spectrum of nonprofits in New York City.

2) social media expertise;  
3) data science & data analytics, and  
4) online & digital fundraising

All partners should have direct experience developing curriculum or teaching courses in one of area that will be developed. Prior experience can include professional training or academic contexts and may have been in-person or online courses in the form of classes, seminars or workshop.

**DOTEVERYONE TRUSTWORTHY TECH SLACK COMMUNITY & PARTNERS PROGRAM**  
[Doteveryone](http://doteveryone.org.uk/)'s Trustworthy Tech slack:  we hope this will become a valuable community of practice for people working on digital /internet technologies and seeking to do so responsibly. All welcome to join - sign up: [bit.ly/TTSlack](http://bit.ly/TTSlack)  
  
The Trustworthy Tech Partners program is an 8 week exploration of how ethical and responsible an organisation's business and technology practices are, and whether it's possible to demonstrate these. Any organisation working on a digital/internet product/service is welcome to take part, and the next program will start on November 20th, and we'd love to have some participants from the Civic Hall community. The program will take participants through exploring what they do today in terms of responsible practices, and what evidence can be provided to demonstrate trustworthiness to external folks (customers, investors, other stakeholders etc). It could take 2-4 hours a week over 8 weeks (depending on scale of organisation) and it's also totally fine to timebox to, say, an hour a week, or to save up tasks to do in a batch on one day. More info in the [program booklet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LKPJv1Enk5YSqqC57-s5H0aMTEXqg1nS/view?usp=sharing) (disregard the dates, these were for our UK program)  
  
Key benefits of participation:   
\* pioneer a better tech sector which is responsible and trustworthy  
\* a structure to help you evaluate your current performance and spot opportunities for improvement  
\* feedback and support from independent confidential external advisors (about the program and other issues around responsible tech development!)

**HOLIDAY HOURS**

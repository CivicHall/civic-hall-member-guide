**MANHATTAN BOROUGH PRESIDENT: COMMUNITY POWERED WAN FOR IOT WITH LORA!**  
The Office of the Manhattan Borough President, Gale A. Brewer and Terrill Moore of The Things Network will lead a[discussion onTuesday, 11/14 at 4:30](https://civichall.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=784ac4a90c07e1e7ebbf294d4&id=47b7ca8203&e=9bb5ebdb18)of how a diverse community of technologists, engineers, and government are working to stand up a wide area network (WAN) for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that covers the entire borough of Manhattan and what that means for the Civic Hacker community. A borough-wide IoT WAN has huge implications for everyone from big data to scrappy not-for-profits. We will talk about current use cases and how LoRa can open new doors for entrepreneurs, students, and advocates alike.   
  
**DOTEVERYONE TRUSTWORTHY TECH SLACK COMMUNITY & PARTNERS PROGRAM**  
[Doteveryone](https://civichall.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=784ac4a90c07e1e7ebbf294d4&id=f4f1704d0e&e=9bb5ebdb18)'s Trustworthy Tech slack:  we hope this will become a valuable community of practice for people working on digital /internet technologies and seeking to do so responsibly. All welcome to join - sign up: [bit.ly/TTSlack](https://civichall.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=784ac4a90c07e1e7ebbf294d4&id=3900803fcc&e=9bb5ebdb18)  
  
The Trustworthy Tech Partners program is an 8 week exploration of how ethical and responsible an organisation's business and technology practices are, and whether it's possible to demonstrate these. Any organisation working on a digital/internet product/service is welcome to take part, and the next program will start on November 20th, and we'd love to have some participants from the Civic Hall community. The program will take participants through exploring what they do today in terms of responsible practices, and what evidence can be provided to demonstrate trustworthiness to external folks (customers, investors, other stakeholders etc). It could take 2-4 hours a week over 8 weeks (depending on scale of organisation) and it's also totally fine to timebox to, say, an hour a week, or to save up tasks to do in a batch on one day. More info in the [program booklet](https://civichall.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=784ac4a90c07e1e7ebbf294d4&id=83a76aafd2&e=9bb5ebdb18) (disregard the dates, these were for our UK program)  
  
Key benefits of participation:   
\* pioneer a better tech sector which is responsible and trustworthy  
\* a structure to help you evaluate your current performance and spot opportunities for improvement  
\* feedback and support from independent confidential external advisors (about the program and other issues around responsible tech development!)

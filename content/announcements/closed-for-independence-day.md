Just a quick reminder that Civic Hall will be closing early today (at 5pm) in celebration of Independence Day. We will resume operations and regular business hours on **Wednesday, July 5, 2017, at ****8:30am**.

As always, we encourage you to continue the exciting conversations around civic tech online via our Slack Channels (please [email us](mailto:community@civichall.org) if you need an invitation).

Wishing you and your family a **Happy 4th of July**, from all of us at Civic Hall!
